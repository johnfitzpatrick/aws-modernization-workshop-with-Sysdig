In particular, we'll guide you on how to implement **ECS Fargate image scanning** with Sysdig Secure. The resulting solution will automatically scan any container image instance that is executed, and will warn you with reports about any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in your workload. It will do this **without leaving your AWS workflow**, and without data leaving your AWS infrastructure.
